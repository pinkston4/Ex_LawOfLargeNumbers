# Law of Large Numbers

This is a basic demonstation of the Law of Large Numbers. 
In a nut shell, the more data you got, the more accurate your prediction.
Think about a coin toss, logically the probablity of heads and tails is equal, but if I flip a coin 5 times, 
I might get four heads and one tails, a 4/1 ratio. But, if i flip the same coin 1000 times I might expect say 56 
heads and 44 tails, much closer to the expected ratio.

##Steps to install

1. Clone the repo
1. Open in Rstudio
1. run the script in r studio by highlighting the script and hitting command enter(for mac), and ctrl enter(windows)
or hit the "Run" button in the corner
1. start the value of n at about 5 and go up from there the larger n gets, the more consistent the result
